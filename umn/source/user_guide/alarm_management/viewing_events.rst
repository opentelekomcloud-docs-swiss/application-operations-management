Viewing Events
==============

Generally, events carry important information, informing you of the changes of AOM itself or an external service such as Cloud Container Engine (CCE). Such changes do not necessarily cause exceptions. Events do not need to be handled.


Viewing Events
--------------

#. In the navigation pane, choose **Alarm Center** > **Event List**.

   Events are displayed by time. The latest event is displayed at the topmost of the event list.

#. View events on the **Event List** page.

   a. Set a time range to view events. There are two methods to set a time range:

      Method 1: Use a predefined time label, such as **Last 1 hour**, **Last 6 hours**, or **Last 1 day** in the upper right corner of the page. You can select a time range as required.

      Method 2: Specify the start time and end time in the upper right corner of the page to customize a time range. You can specify up to 30 days.

   b. Set filter criteria and click |image1| to view the events generated in the specified time range.

      You can click **x** to clear filter criteria.

#. Perform the operations listed in :ref:`Table 1 <aom_02_0045__table48312734713>` as required.
