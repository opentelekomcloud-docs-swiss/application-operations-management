Container Monitoring
====================

The difference between container and component monitoring is that their monitored objects are different. For component monitoring, workloads deployed by using Cloud Container Engine (CCE), and components deployed on Elastic Cloud Server (ECS) are monitored. For container monitoring, only workloads deployed by using CCE are monitored. For details, see :ref:`Component Monitoring <aom_02_0007>`.
